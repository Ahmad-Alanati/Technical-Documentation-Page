      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>C++ is a popular high-level programming language used to create a wide variety of applications, from games to
        operating systems.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
      <header>Data Types</header>
      <p>C++ provides a range of data types to work with, including primitive types like int, float, and char, as well
        as more complex types like arrays and structures. You can also create your own custom data types using classes
        and templates.</p>
      <code>int x = 10</code>
    </section>
    <section id="Control_Structures" class="main-section">
      <header>Control Structures</header>
      <p>C++ provides a range of control structures to allow you to direct the flow of your program. These include
        if-else statements, loops like for and while, and switch statements.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Functions" class="main-section">
      <header>Functions</header>
      <p>Functions allow you to encapsulate a block of code that can be called from other parts of your program. They
        can take parameters and return values, and can be used to simplify complex code.</p>
      <code>int main(){
          return 0;
        }
        </code>
    </section>
    <section id="Classes" class="main-section">
      <header>Classes</header>
      <p>Classes are a key feature of C++ and allow you to create your own custom data types. A class can contain data
        members (variables) and member functions (methods), and can be used to represent real-world objects.</p>
      <pre><code>class MyClass {
          // Class members (data and functions)
          public:
          // Public member functions and variables
          private:
          // Private member functions and variables
          protected:
          // Protected member functions and variables
};</code>
</pre>
      <pre><code>class Circle {
            public:
            // Constructor
            Circle(double r) {
            radius = r;
          }

        // Public member function to get the area of the circle
        double getArea() {
        return 3.14 * radius * radius;
      }
      private:
      // Private member variable to store the radius
      double radius;
};</code></pre>
<pre><code>int main() {
  // Create a circle object with radius 5.0
  Circle myCircle(5.0);

  // Call the getArea() function and print the result
  double area = myCircle.getArea();
  std::cout << "The area of the circle is: " << area << std::endl;

  return 0;
}</code></pre>
    </section>
    <section id="Templates" class="main-section">
      <header>Templates</header>
      <p>Templates allow you to create generic functions and classes that can work with a range of data types. This can
        be particularly useful when you need to write code that can be reused in multiple places.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Standard_Library" class="main-section">
      <header>Standard Library</header>
      <p>C++ comes with a large standard library that provides a range of pre-built functions and classes for common
        tasks. This includes input/output operations, containers like vectors and maps, and algorithms like sorting and
        searching.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="c++_vs_java" class="main-section">
      <header>c++ vs java</header>
      <p>C++ and Java are two popular programming languages with their own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some key
        differences between the two:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Performance: C++ is generally considered to be a faster language than Java due to its emphasis on direct
          memory manipulation and its ability to optimize code at compile time. However, Java has made significant
          strides in recent years to improve its performance, especially with the introduction of just-in-time (JIT)
          compilers.</li>
        <li>Memory Management: C++ requires manual memory management, which means that the programmer must explicitly
          allocate and deallocate memory for objects. Java, on the other hand, uses automatic memory management through
          a garbage collector, which can make programming faster and less error-prone.</li>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programming: Both languages support object-oriented programming, but Java is often
          considered to be more "purely" object-oriented. Java has strict rules for object creation, and everything in
          Java is an object, including primitive data types like integers and booleans. C++ allows for more flexibility
          in how objects are created and managed.</li>
        <li>Platform Independence: Java programs are designed to be platform-independent, meaning that they can be run
          on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. C++, on the other hand, requires that separate
          code be written for each platform on which it will be run.</li>
        <li>Syntax and Code Structure: C++ and Java have different syntax and code structure, with C++ being more
          flexible and Java being more structured. C++ uses pointers to manipulate memory, while Java uses references.
          C++ allows for multiple inheritance, while Java only supports single inheritance.</li>
        <li>Libraries and Frameworks: Both languages have large and active developer communities with many libraries and
          frameworks available. However, Java has a larger number of libraries and frameworks due to its popularity in
          enterprise development.</li>
      </ol>

      <header>key features</header>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Object-oriented programming: C++ is an object-oriented language, which means that it supports the creation
          of objects that encapsulate data and behavior.</li>
        <li>High performance: C++ is a high-performance language, with low-level control over memory and direct access
          to hardware resources, making it ideal for applications where speed is critical.</li>
        <li>OCross-platform: C++ code can be compiled and run on a wide variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS,
          Linux, and embedded systems.</li>
        <li>Extensible: C++ is an extensible language that allows programmers to create new data types and functions
          that can be used in their programs.</li>
        <li>Standard library: C++ comes with a large standard library that provides a range of functions and data types
          for common programming tasks, such as input/output, data structures, and algorithms.</li>
        <li>Template meta-programming: C++ supports template meta-programming, which allows for generic programming and
          the creation of reusable code.</li>
        <li>Compatibility with C: C++ is backward-compatible with C, meaning that C code can be easily integrated into
          C++ programs.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <header>Overall</header>
      <p>Overall, C++ is a powerful and flexible language with many features and capabilities. With a little practice,
        you can use it to create efficient and effective programs for a wide range of applications.</p>
